    "1) The \"Equilibrium Temperature\" given is described as:\n",
    "> Approximation for the temperature of the planet. The calculation of equilibrium temperature assumes \n",
    "  - a) thermodynamic equilibrium between the incident stellar flux and the radiated heat from the planet;\n",
    "  - b) a Bond albedo (the fraction of total power incident upon the planet scattered back into space) of 0.3;\n",
    "  - c) the planet and star are blackbodies; \n",

    "  - d) the heat is evenly distributed between the day and night sides of the planet. \n",

    "For instance, (d) could *wildly* change depending on how the planet exists - is it tidally locked? If so then the sun-side could be far too hot, whereas the dark-side could be far too cold; average these out, however, and it would seem to suggest a \"just right\" zone.\n",

    "2) [This wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone) suggests that it also depends on the distance from the star, the ratio of flux emitted to absorbed, and how much of the planet's orbit is contained within the habitable zone (eg, exoplanets with highly eccentric orbits may pass in and out of the habitable zone). See [this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Diagram_of_different_habitable_zone_regions_by_Chester_Harman.jpg) for a simplified but succinct explanation"
