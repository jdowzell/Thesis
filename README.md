# Thesis

These are the software versions I currently have on my machine:

- Python Version used: 3.5.1
- NumPy Version number is: 1.14.2
- Pandas Version number is: 0.18.0
- MatPlotLib Version number is: 1.5.1
- SKLearn Version number is: 0.17.1

### TO-DO FOR 2019-05-31:

1. Read [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (ch. 1-4 skim; ch. 5 thorough)
2. Get sklearn toolkit and follow some tutorials to get you started, this should include:
    - Import some data (understand how that data should be structured)
    - Process data in some way
    - visualize the data appropriately  
3. Attempt to import your exoplanet or unknown planet data and perform some sort of clustering procedure
4. Propose a specific set of steps which might help you address your primary question or a sensible question of your choosing, for example:  Is planet ‘X’ able to sustain life?
5. Work in jupyter notebooks, and as much as possible/reasonable make those available to us through github.
