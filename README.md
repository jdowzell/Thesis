- SKLearn Version number is: 0.21.2

%### TO-DO FOR 2019-05-31:
%
%1. Read [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) (ch. 1-4 skim; ch. 5 thorough)
%2. Get sklearn toolkit and follow some tutorials to get you started, this should include:
%    - Import some data (understand how that data should be structured)
%    - Process data in some way
%    - visualize the data appropriately
%3. Attempt to import your exoplanet or unknown planet data and perform some sort of clustering procedure
%4. Propose a specific set of steps which might help you address your primary question or a sensible question of your choosing, for example:  Is planet ‘X’ able to sustain life?
%    - Does it sit in the Goldilocks zone?
%        - Distance from star
%            - Dependant on the size of the star
%            - Inverse Square Law
%        - Orbital period
%        - Day length
%    - Is it rocky or gasseous?
%        - By and large, rocky planets more likely to house life
%        - Not necessarily though as oceanic/vaporous life possible
%    - Any spectral emission data?
%        - If not, which is most likely case, can only attempt to imply
%        - Unsure if there is enough spectral data available to form meaningful conclusions
%5. Work in jupyter notebooks, and as much as possible/reasonable make those available to us through github.

%### Questions/Issues:
%So far, this is a straight-forward classification issue: Get data; choose params; plug in; visualise; win all the prizes. However, so far, there's no use of Evolutionary Computational methods to modify this. My ideas were:
%1. Use ECM to minimise unclassified entities
%    - Though unsure if this is possible, as this might be encompassed within the algos themselves already
%2. ...
%3. ...
